        "Patna: Even as the Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) logjam continues over seat allocation in Bihar, some of the smaller partners in the opposition grand alliance have started asserting their position, making it even more difficult to reach a consensus on seat sharing for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections",
        "Besides RJD and Congress, the grand alliance (GA) in Bihar comprises Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP), Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and the left parties",
        " While all eyes are on the outcome of the recent talks between RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has reportedly demanded that his party be given seats on a par with RLSP, which is led by former union minister Upendra Kushwaha",
        "Meanwhile, there is still confusion over seat allocation among the left parties",
        " While CPI has demanded at least three seats, CPM is vying for the Ujiarpur seat, which is represented by BJP\u2019s state unit president Nityanand Rai in the current in Lok Sabha",
        " Our leader D Raja, who recently met RJD chief Lalu Prasad at RIMS, Ranchi, has already communicated CPI\u2019s demand,\u201d CPI state secretary Satyanarayan Singh told ET on phone",
        " CPI has support base in areas like Begusarai, Madhubani, Motihari and Khagaria",
        " Sources said CPI is looking for at least three seats to contest as its share in the GA",
        "Sources said CPI (ML), which had fielded its candidates on 23 seats in the 2014 LS election, also wants a good share of seats in GA",
        " It is already preparing to contest from six seats\u2014Ara, Siwan, Jahanabad, Karakat, Patliputra and Valmikinagar",
        " We are in touch with senior leaders of RJD to negotiate seats for our party in GA,\u201d CPI (ML) secretary Kunal told ET",
        "The Darbangha seat is also set to become a conflict point between GA partners with former BJP MP Kirti Azad joining Congress",
        " Azad, who was elected to Lok Sabha on a BJP ticket from Darbhanga in 2014, wants to contest from the same seat as a Congress nominee",
        " And so does VIP leader Mukesh Shahni",
        " VIP was accommodated in the GA by RJD",
        " If Kirti Azad contests as Congress party\u2019s nominee from Darbhanga seat, RJD is supposed to spare a suitable seat for VIP in GA,\u201d a source in RJD said",
        "Moreover, Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav is reportedly looking to become a part of GA in Bihar",
        " but Congress has not taken any decision so far on Yadav\u2019s entry",
        " RJD does not want Pappu to become a part of GA",
        " So, it will be a difficult decision for Congress to accommodate Pappu,\u201d a source in RJD said"

        " BJP is using the 10% reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS) in the general category to mobilise these votes",
